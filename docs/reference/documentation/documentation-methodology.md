# Documentation Methology

This projects documentation is an attempt to structure the most critical thoughts and processes of my homelab experience into a single space. The documentation methodology that I chose to *loosely* follow is [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) since I feel it can encapsulate everything needed in the most simplistic way.

The structure of this site is broken into 4 main parts:

- [Setup (tutorial)](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials): learning-oriented
- [Concepts (explanation)](https://diataxis.fr/explanation): understanding-oriented
- [How-to (how-to guides)](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides): goal-oriented
- [Reference (reference)](https://diataxis.fr/reference): information-oriented
