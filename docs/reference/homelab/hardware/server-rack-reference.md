# Server Rack

Most of my homelab is housed within a 22u Sysracks Server Rack. The Sysracks enclosure that I purchased was a short depth (24in) with perferated gaps in the front door and side panels for airflow. I upgraded from a 12u fully enclosed glass front rack to expand my networking capabilities, as well as to provide additional space for future growth. Since most of my components were picked for low noise and power consumption, it was required to have adequate airflow to allow for proper cooling of the devices. Some of my rack solutions are custom made 3D printed parts.
