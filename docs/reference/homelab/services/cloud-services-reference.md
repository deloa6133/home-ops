# Cloud Services

Not everything in a homelab *should* nor *can* be self-hosted. Along with the free self-hosted services currently hosted on my homelab, I also utilize various cloud services or need specific licencing to use certain products. Due to this, here is a list of all of the free as well as paid cloud products/services that I am currently using in my homelab. Additionally, there is a rough breakdown of how much I pay per month with each of these services.

| Service                                                 | Use                                                            | Cost           |
