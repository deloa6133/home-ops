        The issue specifically relates to Jumper #14, as indicated in the diagram.

    Steps to Reproduce:
        To reproduce the issue:
            Ensure Jumper #14 is in place on the PiKVM v3 HAT.
            Connect the Raspberry Pi to a TESsmart 16 port HDMI KVM switch.
            If the Pi is connected to the HDMI output on the KVM switch, it may not turn on properly due to HDMI supplying current to the Pi. This backpower issue prevents proper operation.

    Resolution:

    Step 1: Access the Jumper Settings
        Ensure the Raspberry Pi and the PiKVM v3 HAT are accessible.

    Step 2: Locate Jumper #14
        Refer to the diagram provided above to identify Jumper #14.

    Step 3: Remove Jumper #14
        To remove Jumper #14:
            Power off the Raspberry Pi and disconnect all cables.
            Locate Jumper #14 on the PiKVM v3 HAT, which is positioned as shown in the diagram.
            Gently use a pair of tweezers or a similar tool to lift and remove Jumper #14. Be cautious not to damage any other components.
            Ensure the jumper is completely removed.

    Step 4: Verify the Resolution
        To confirm that the HDMI backpower issue is resolved:
            Reconnect all necessary cables to the Raspberry Pi.
            Power on the Raspberry Pi.
            Monitor for any issues related to HDMI backpower. If the issue is resolved, the Raspberry Pi should operate without unexpected behaviors.

    Conclusion:
        By following these steps, you should have successfully resolved the HDMI backpower issue by removing Jumper #14 from the PiKVM v3 HAT. Ensure you follow these steps carefully for a stable setup.
