# Archive

Many of the information that I have learned over my homelab's progression is no longer applicable to the current state of the homelab. Due to this, I did not want this information to become lost and forgotten, so the archives were created. The idea for the archive is to act as a dumping ground for any and all past information and projects that are no longer in use.
