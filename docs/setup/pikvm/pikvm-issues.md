# PiKVM Issues and Fixes

This is a collection of issues encountered when setting up a Raspberry Pi PiKVM device. This is a growing list and will continue to be modified and improved over time.

### Intel Nuc CSI Bridge Compatibility Error

When using an Intel Nuc, the Nuc's CSI Bridge while navigating the BIOS interferes with the PiKVM default EDID value. This is a known issue on PiKVM's documentation and can be found [here](https://docs.pikvm.org/edid/) *(As of 03/13/2024)*.

Without the EDID update, while in Intel Nuc BIOS, the PiKVM WebGUI KVM output is a black screen with no input/output. The default EDID value must be modified to the following:

```hex
00FFFFFFFFFFFF005262888800888888

### HDMI Backpower

The HDMI Backpower issue occurs during the initial startup/setup of the PiKVM and may lead to unexpected behavior or instability.

To reproduce the issue:
    Ensure Jumper #14 is in place on the PiKVM v3 HAT.
    Connect the Raspberry Pi to a TESsmart 16 port HDMI KVM switch.
    If the Pi is connected to the HDMI output on the KVM switch, it may not turn on properly due to HDMI supplying current to the Pi. This backpower issue prevents proper operation.

Resolution:

Step 1: Access the Jumper Settings
    Ensure the Raspberry Pi and the PiKVM v3 HAT are accessible.

Step 2: Locate Jumper #14
    Refer to the diagram provided above to identify Jumper #14.

Step 3: Remove Jumper #14
    To remove Jumper #14:
        Power off the Raspberry Pi and disconnect all cables.
        Locate Jumper #14 on the PiKVM v3 HAT, which is positioned as shown in the diagram.
        Gently use a pair of tweezers or a similar tool to lift and remove Jumper #14. Be cautious not to damage any other components.
        Ensure the jumper is completely removed.
