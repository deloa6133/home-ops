# Debian Installation

The current setup of the management node runs on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/intro/about) (*debian-12.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso as of 2024-08-14*). Follow the steps below to install and configure Debian on the management node to prepare it for use.

## Create the Debian Boot Drive

To install Debian onto the management node, first download the latest version of Debian [here](https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst). Once downloaded, flash the **.iso** image to a bootable drive using a tool such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) (if using a Windows machine).

On the management node, boot from the newly created Debian boot drive, to begin the installation process.
