# Github Respository Setup

Since this repository is the source of truth for my homelab, it is required to fork/download the repository and set up all required components. My repository is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/) but can be hosted on other version control platforms such as [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/), [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/), etc. Some of the functionality within my homelab relies on [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), so be aware that by utilizing a different hosting platform, some functionality may be different or may not be possible.

Note that this guide will use Github as the version control platform since that is what I am currently using. Other platforms may be slightly different so it is impossible to document for all scenarios. It is recommended to follow along by using Github to avoid any issues.

[Github](https://github.com/) is a powerful version control platform which allows for the management and modification of Git repositories. To begin the setup, fork from the [home-ops](https://github.com/ol3d/home-ops) repository.
