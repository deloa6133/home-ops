# PVE Setup

## Download and Install Proxmox

Download [Proxmox VE 7.2](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads) and flash it to a bootable drive using a tool such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

On the Proxmox system, boot from the newly created boot drive, and install Proxmox VE onto the system.
