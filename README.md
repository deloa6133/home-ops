# Home-Ops

The goal of this repository is to be a source of truth and to automate as much of my homelab as possible. This project utilizes [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) and [GitOps](https://codefresh.io/learn/gitops/) to simplify provisioning, operating, and updating self-hosted services in my homelab. The effort put into the various automation flows makes the ease of teardown and setup worth it.
